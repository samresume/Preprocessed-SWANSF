# Preprocessed-SWANSF
The SWAN-SF dataset is now fully preprocessed, optimized, and ready for classification tasks.

We are pleased to announce the release of the preprocessed SWAS-SF dataset across all five partitions. This enhanced version incorporates our Similarity-based KNN Imputation technique, elimination of Class C samples to address class overlap issues, and the implementation of both over- and under-sampling strategies, including Random Under Sampling, Tomek Links, and TimeGAN. Additionally, LSBZM normalization has been applied. This optimized dataset enables researchers to focus their efforts on developing more precise classifiers, rather than on preprocessing, thereby aiming to improve the TSS score.
